					+ " Oh yes, this man who I will speak as for the rest of the story, for story-telling reasons, grabbed some bread to feed the birds. Now I didn't exactly know at the time that feeding certain types of bread to birds caused them to swell up like feather covered balls."
					+ " It was definitely the mistake of a naive young man but, luckly for me, it was a private mistake. Anyways, while I feeding these birds, this man came to talk to me about a 'room without walls' or 'walls without a room' which was odd because I'm an architect on my spare time and its safe to say that a room is most definitely defined by its walls."
					+ " So... Anyways, I remember him saying something about a glowing lantern to show the way into this so called 'room without walls' to find enlightenment and personal growth. At this point, I just told him 'Foriru de mi, kultisto'. Sadly, I must of spoken the right set of words or something because he decided to stick around and act friendly to me."
					+ " Kept saying things like, 'Ne zorgu, ne timu.' and 'Mi elektas esti feliÄ‰a kun vi, mia frato'. I just laughed and replied 'Dankon, frato.' but I don't remember much after that. I think around that point I had to go and catch my midnight flight to Pennsylvania. After I visited the town of Centralia, which is a whole other story for another day,"
					+ "I think I understood what he meant by a 'Room with no walls' as I walked through the powerless town with my camping lantern. Funny times. Wonderful Memories of a younger man I met long ago.";
